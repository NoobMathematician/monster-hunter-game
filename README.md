+ I make this game in my free time to learn Unity.
### In the *Assets* folder: 
+ *2D Platformer Tileset*: I downloaded it from Unity store so I had tileset/sprites to make the game. 
+ *AstarPathfindingProject*: this is a Pathfinding package I downloaded from [A* Pathfinding Project](https://arongranberg.com/astar/ "Named link title") . I attached the *Pathfinder* script of this package to a game object (named FindPath) to enable *Grid Graph* and *Collision testing* functions in Unity. Then, I made my own AI (*BatAI* script) for my enemy (the small bat) to automatically locate and fly to the player.   
+ *Animations*, *Prefabs* , *Scenes*, and *Scripts* : I made all animations, prefabs, scenes, and scripts there.
